Building these components often requires extensive domain expertise and may contain brittle design choices. Here, we are using **Tacotron**, an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model that synthesizes speech directly from characters. Given `<text, audio>` pairs, the model can be trained completely from scratch with random initialization. Tacotron achieves a 3.82 subjective 5-scale mean opinion score on US English, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness.It does not require phoneme-level alignment, so it can easily scale to using large amounts of acoustic data with transcripts. In addition, since Tacotron generates speech at the frame level, it’s substantially faster than sample-level autoregressive methods."

Among neural TTS models, autoregressive models such as Tacotron 2 show the state-of-the-art performance. Based on these autoregressive models, there have been many advances in generating diverse speech in terms of modelling different speaking styles or various prosodies.\n",

        "espite the high quality of autoregressive TTS models, there are a few difficulties in deploying end-to-end autoregressive models directly in real-time services. As the synthesizing time of the models grows linearly with the output length, undesirable delay caused by generating long speech can be propagated to the multiple pipelines of TTS systems without designing sophisticated frameworks. In addition, most of the autoregressive models show lack of robustness in some cases. For example, when the input text includes the repeated words, autoregressive TTS models often produce serious attention errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "To overcome such limitations of the autoregressive TTS models, parallel TTS models such as **FastSpeech** have been proposed. These models can synthesize mel-spectrogram significantly faster than the autoregressive TTS models. In addition to the fast sampling, FastSpeech reduces the failure cases for the extremely hard sentences by enforcing its alignment monotonic.\n",

        "However, these strengths of parallel TTS models come from the well-aligned attention map between text and speech, which is extracted from their external aligner. Recently proposed parallel models address these challenges by extracting attention maps from the pre-trained autoregressive models. Therefore, the performance of the parallel TTS models critically depends on that of the autoregressive TTS models. Furthermore, since the parallel TTS models assume this alignment to be given during training, they cannot be trained without the external aligners.\n",

Glow-TTS is directly trained to maximize the log-likelihood of speech given text, and its sampling process is totally parallel due to the properties of the generative flow. In order to eliminate any dependency on other networks, we introduce Monotonic Alignment Search (MAS), a novel method to search for the most probable monotonic alignment with only text and latent representation of speech. This internal alignment search algorithm simplifies the entire training procedure of our parallel TTS models so that it requires only 3 days for training on two GPUs.\n",

        "Without any external aligner, our parallel TTS model can generate mel-spectrograms 15.7 times faster than the autoregressive TTS model, Tacotron 2, while maintaining the comparable performance. Glow-TTS also provides diverse speech synthesis, in contrast to other TTS models, which have their stochasticities only in dropout operations. We can control some properties of synthesized samples from Glow-TTS by altering the latent variable of normalizing flows.\n"
